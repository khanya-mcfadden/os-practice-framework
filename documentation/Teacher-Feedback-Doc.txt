Decomposition and algorithgm notes :
genral not about algorithm designs, needs anotation (goses for whole class)


You need to break down each problem more thoroughly. For example, explain how the system will manage the booking process to avoid overbooking, how it will reallocate cancelled spaces, and how it will notify users when spaces become available. Consider discussing potential risks and challenges, such as handling high volumes of users or preventing system downtime. 


Appreciation of Wider Issues in Context (Band 2 - 4-6 Marks) 
You have identified important wider issues like security and performance but need to explain in more detail why they matter and how you will manage them. For example, how will the system handle compliance with GDPR, especially considering you are dealing with minors? Additionally, go into more depth on scalability—what will happen if hundreds of users try to book at once? What load testing strategies will you employ? Address legal considerations, particularly with regards to children’s data and system resilience. 
Appreciation of Business Context Band 1 (1-3 Marks)  
You need to explain how the proposed solution addresses the business’s specific goals. For example, how will the admin pages improve event management? How will the booking system help CoderDojo deal with their current issues, such as over-attendance? Show more awareness of how your solution will improve operational efficiency, reduce errors, and enhance user experience. Tie each feature back to a specific business need to demonstrate a better understanding of the context. 

Functional and Non-Functional Requirements Band 2 (4-6 Marks)
Good work in defining both functional and non-functional requirements, with clear reasoning for each page and feature. Your use of KPIs such as load times, system uptime, and user satisfaction is thorough and well aligned with the goals of the business. To improve, include more detail about how you will measure user satisfaction (e.g., through surveys or feedback) and how these KPIs will be tracked over time.  
Expand on the functional and non-functional requirements by providing more detail on how each will be implemented. For example, how will the booking system handle cancellations and waiting lists? What database architecture will be used to store user information securely? Explain why these requirements are essential to the system’s success and how they will be achieved using technologies like Flask, SQLite, and Stripe. 
key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of the Solution Band 1 (1-3 Marks) 
You need to explain how each KPI will be measured and why it is important. For example, how will you track system uptime and what tools will be used to measure it? Explain how the KPIs will help CoderDojo assess the performance of the system and make improvements over time. Link the KPIs back to the client’s goals to show how they will ensure the solution is meeting expectations. 

Justifying How the Recommended Solution Meets the Needs of Clients and Users Band 1 (1-3 Marks) 

Give more detailed justification of how your solution meets the specific needs of the client and users. For example, explain how the admin pages will help organisers manage bookings, reduce over-attendance, and track participant data more efficiently. For users, discuss how the booking system will streamline the registration process and improve their overall experience, particularly for busy parents booking for children. 
Justifying the Potential Risks and How These Will Be Mitigated Band 1 (1-3 Marks) 
You have identified some risks, but you need to provide a more detailed plan for how you will mitigate them. For example, how will you ensure that the system remains secure from attacks? What backup strategies will you use to prevent data loss or system downtime? Discuss how you will address legal compliance risks, particularly when dealing with minors’ data, and explain how regular system testing and monitoring will help mitigate risks. 
Regulatory Guidelines and Legal Requirements Band 1 (1-3 Marks) 
Give a clearer explanation of how the system will ensure compliance with GDPR and other relevant legal requirements. How will user data be collected, stored, and secured? How will the system obtain consent from users, especially when dealing with minors? Discuss how parental controls and age verification will be implemented to ensure the platform is safe and compliant with regulations.
