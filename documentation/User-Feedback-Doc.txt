Feedback Gathering Report Checklist

Planning

☑ Define the purpose of gathering feedback, ensuring it is meaningful, measurable, complete, and consistent.

☑ Specify the aspects of feedback to be gathered (e.g., technical performance, usability).

Identify and categorise the audience:

☑ Technical audience (e.g., developers, software engineers).
☐ Non-technical audience (e.g., end-users, stakeholders).
☑ Provide details for each audience member, including:
  - Name
  - Skill set
  - Relevance
  - Age group

Methodology

☑ Select suitable feedback collection methods (e.g., surveys, polls, interviews).

☑ Develop at least 20 technical feedback questions, as a plan

☑ Develop at least 20 non-technical feedback questions as a plan

☑ Justify the choice of methods for gathering feedback.

Feedback Collection

☐ Plan tasks for distributing surveys:

  - Detail the timeline, distribution method, and recording process.

☑ Schedule polls, interviews, or focus groups:

  - Include dates, times, and the platform to be used.

☐ Plan and send follow-up reminders to maximise response rates.

☑ Track and record all responses.

Prototype Preparation

☑ Prepare the prototype using appropriate tools (e.g., screencasts, videos, hosting online).

☑ Explain how these tools will ensure high-quality feedback.

Implementation Phase

☑ Finalise and distribute surveys and polls, adhering to the distribution plan.

☑ Send reminders and document the tracking process.

Gathering Feedback

☑ Record feedback systematically, including:

  - User name
  - Skill set
  - Technical or non-technical category
  - Date feedback requested
  - Date feedback received
  - Follow-up sent (yes/no)
  - Key notes and observations

Summary of Findings
